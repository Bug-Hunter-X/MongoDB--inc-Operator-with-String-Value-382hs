# MongoDB $inc Operator with String Value

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the MongoDB $inc operator. The $inc operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value. However, attempting to increment a field with a non-numeric value (such as a string) will result in an error.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version.
